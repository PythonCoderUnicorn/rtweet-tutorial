# Get Started

---





# rtweet library

Install the **rtweet** package from [Github](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) or from CRAN:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages("rtweet")
library(rtweet)
```

--

You are required to have a Twitter API access key in order to 
use the library.

- A user *must* authenticate their interaction with Twitter's API. If 
you already have an access token key, then a browser popup will 
appear where you need to click on permissions and verification.

--

- Once you have this set up you are ready to go

# Data Mine the hashtags

# Needed libraries

You will require a few more libraries to follow along with the slides: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rtweet)     # needed for Twitter API
library(tidyverse)  # for data manipulation
library(ggplot2)    # for plotting 
library(tidytext)   # for text analysis
library(ggraph)     # graphing words
library(showtext)   # for font styling
library(widyr)      # dataframe manipulation
library(tidyr)
library(DT)
```

If you are not interested in graphing the word associations and frequencies, then you just need:
- rtweet
- tidyverse
- ggplot


---

# Step 1 - Find a #hashtag

You can see a trending hashtag on Twitter or use a word / phrase to get tweets on that specific hashtag/ phrase. For this example we will use #DragRace. The rate limit is 
**max** 18,000 tweets per API call. We are not interested in retweets for this hashtag and set the function to false. Language settings are set to return English tweets only.
**Note**: You can search tweets <= 9 days ago for free, otherwise you need to pay Twitter to access older tweets.

**search Twitter for all tweets with #DragRace**

```
# give your search_tweets() a variable

DragRace_tweets = search_tweets2(
  "#DragRace",         # hashtag we are interested in
  n= 18000,            # max amount of tweets in 1 API request
  lang = "en",         # English
  include_rts = FALSE  # no retweets
)
```

It is **strongly advised** you make use of variable names for your Twitter data as to avoid `rate limit` (getting timed-out for 15 minutes or Twitter Developer account suspended which is the account that has the API key). If you rate_limit too often, there will be the message in the console and you will lose privileges with the Twitter Developer account which makes your API key void.
---



--- 
# Step 2 - Save your search Tweets

This is very important to do as to avoid executing the `search_tweets2()` function again within 15 minutes and seeing a `rate_limit` warning message in the console. Seeing a `rate_limit` warning is scary to see but really means you have to wait at least 15 minutes to try to run the code again. 

To get `rate limit` info for specific token (function call)
- `token <- get_tokens()`
- `rate_limit(token)`
- `rate_limit(token, "search_tweets")`

```
#   query         limit remaining reset    reset_at            timestamp           
# 1 search/tweets   180       180 15.0119… 2021-09-02 09:42:08 2021-09-02 09:27:08 
```

**SAVE YOUR TWITTER SEARCHES**
```
DragRace_tweets = write_as_csv(
  DragRace_tweets,               # variable name used
  file_name = "DragRace_tweets", # new variable name for CSV file
  prepend_ids = TRUE,            # set to true 
  na = "",
  fileEncoding = "UTF-8"         # save file in UTF-8 
)
```


---
# Step 3 - read in saved data

```{r include=FALSE}
DragRace_tweets = read_twitter_csv(file ="../TwitterData/DragRace_tweets.csv" , unflatten = FALSE)
```

DragRace_tweets = read_twitter_csv(file = "../TwitterData/DragRace_tweets.csv" , 
  unflatten = FALSE)

`DragRace_tweets` has 13,000 rows (obs.) and 91 columns (variables)

# Text Analysis of Tweets






---
# #DragRace

**The Twitter API returns lots of meta-data information.** 
Only 6 rows of the Tweets dataframe text is shown. This is raw Twitter text data that is messy with `url`s, emojis and `\n` new lines.

this is `head(DragRace_tweets$text)`
```{r echo=FALSE}
# head(DragRace_tweets$text)
# df = head(DragRace_tweets,10)
# 
# df %>%
#   DT::datatable(fillContainer = F, options = list(pageLength=3)) %>%
#   DT::formatStyle(0, target = "row", lineHeight='20%')
```

# just the text - 1

The Twitter data we have is messy and has url links, need to remove them.
```{r}
# ======== remove URLs
DragRace_tweets$stripped_text = gsub("http.*","", DragRace_tweets$text)
DragRace_tweets$stripped_text = gsub("https*","", DragRace_tweets$stripped_text)

# head(DragRace_tweets$stripped_text)
```

- Note: the dataframe has `stripped_text` column (variable) which will be used again later for bigrams.

# just the text - 2

This code **tokenizes** the words to allow for easy word counts and further text analysis. 

```{r}

  select(stripped_text) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, stripped_text) # tokens

head(clean_DragRace_tweets)

`clean_DragRace_tweets` has 164,460 obs. and 1 variable

# Further Information

- I have a detailed rtweet guide (learnr file) that tells you pretty much all of the documentation with understandable examples. 

- Twitter CSV datasets are available on GitHub for you to practice with for those without a API key. 

- **Thank you** RLadies Coventry Heather Turner & Sophie Hardy for this opportunity 🍁
